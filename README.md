# Remind Me in an Hour

An Applescript-based Automator Service that reminds you to come back to a URL in an hour. That's it.

## Installation

After downloading the repo, open the `.workflow` folder in Finder. That should do it?

## Usage

Any time you encounter a URL in OS X, you **should** be able to right-click it and a "Remind me in an hour" option will be available. This is especially useful in the URL bar in Safari.
